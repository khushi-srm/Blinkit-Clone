The aim of this Blinkit clone project is to practice web design skills by creating a static and responsive grocery delivery website layout using only HTML and CSS. The project will replicate the visual structure of the Blinkit homepage, including navigation bar, banner section, product categories, product cards, and footer to improve layout design, responsiveness, and UI structuring.
